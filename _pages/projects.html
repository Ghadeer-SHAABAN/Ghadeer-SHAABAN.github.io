            <p class="description">This project aims to design and execute 3 DOF Helicopter, as it also aims to control the stability of the system. At first, we designed the mechanism of the platform and selected its components: motors, driving circuits and propellers. Also, we studied the dynamism of the platform and we found the mathematical and dynamic model which the platform follows. Control law is conducted on MATLAB Simulink which work real time with the platform.

                        The importance of this project comes from the fact that it deals with
                        a fundamental problem that occur in most tube-based applications. This
                        project provides a reliable solution to overcome such problems.

                        aims to control the stability of the system. Work has been accomplished by using the BeagleBone Blue
                        development kit, also a communication module has been executed,
                        this module consists of a computer with Joystick, via this Joysticks
                        the control orders can be made and they are sent to the controller via
                        bluetooth.
